# WPFDemo

(c) Nigel Booth 2022.

This is just a simple app that is going to progressivly be added to to demonstrate different attributes and abilities of WPF apps written using XAML and C#.
The first attribute is the gradient colour scheme (color if you are in the USA) which is set using XAML only.
The second attribute is a date loader which is set using the Label control in XAML and then using the DateTime object in C#.
